TODO / Notes:
    1. Tight coupling and lose coupling.
    2. lose coupling help in unit testing.
    3. To do lose coupling, dependency injector comes into picture.
    4. Dependency inversion: giving control to Spring to handle dependencies.
    5. Can be done via: Annotation Based Config, JAVA Based config, XML Config
    6. to add dependency we use POM.XML which is like .YAML in flutter.
